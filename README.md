```
**Installation notes**
- Read the README files =)
- Install xinetd. Controls the journalnet service (service xinetd start | stop).
- Execute install.sh
- Restart xinetd service.
- Default port is tcp 2826
- Create file .journal inside a user home folder or copy a template and rename it to .journal
- Read client options ./journal -h
- Test with ./journal -B username@127.0.0.1 or ./journal -B username@your.dynamic.dns  
  (Remove "-B" to hide the Banner).
- In the Console pipe the Journal Client through less "-r" to scroll the ".journal" and colorize the Banner:  
./journal -B username@127.0.0.1 | less -r or ./journal -B username@your.dynamic.dns | less -r    
Tip:  Press ":q" to exit (Or use alternatives like tmux and screen). 
- You can read ".journal's" with netcat (Tested with OpenBSD netcat):  
echo "username" | nc -N 127.0.0.1 2826 or echo "username" | nc -N your.dynamic.dns 2826    
echo "username" | nc -q 0 127.0.0.1 2826 or echo "username" | nc -q 0 your.dynamic.dns 2826  
  
```
